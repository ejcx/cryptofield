#cryptofield
cryptofield is a zero dependency library for pushing and visualizing data on an html5 canvas.

#Getting started
Remember to include cryptofield.js in your webpage.
```
<script src="cryptofield.js"></script>
```
Next, create a cryptofield div.
```
<div class='cryptofield'></script>
```
You can manually set the size by adding a size directive to the classname. This will create an image that is 64x64 pixels.
```
<div class='cryptofield size64'></script>
```
